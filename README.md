# Simple URL Checker (C Project - Illustrative Only)

This is a *very basic* C project demonstrating a simplified URL checking mechanism against a blacklist.  It is provided for *illustrative purposes only* and is *not* a real-world parental control solution.  Real-world parental control systems require much more sophisticated techniques and careful consideration of ethical and legal implications.

**Disclaimer:** This code is *not* intended for actual use in a parental control system.  It is a highly simplified example for educational purposes only.  Using this code in a real-world scenario without significant modifications and addressing ethical and legal concerns is strongly discouraged.  Please use established and reputable parental control software for actual parental control needs.

## Features (Highly Simplified)

*   Checks if a given URL is present in a blacklist.
*   Blacklist is loaded from and saved to a text file (`blacklist.txt`).

## Build Instructions (using GCC)

1.  Save all `.c` and `.h` files in the same directory.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
3.  Compile:
    ```bash
    gcc main.c blacklist.c -o url_checker
    ```
4.  Run:
    ```bash
    ./url_checker
    ```

## Usage

1.  Run the executable (`./url_checker`).
2.  Enter a URL when prompted.
3.  The program will indicate whether the URL is blocked (found in the blacklist) or allowed.

## File Format

The blacklist is stored in a plain text file named `blacklist.txt`. Each line in the file represents a URL or a part of a URL to be blocked.

## Code Structure

*   `blacklist.h`: Defines the interface for the blacklist functions.
*   `blacklist.c`: Implements the blacklist checking and file I/O functions.
*   `main.c`: Contains the `main` function and handles user interaction.

## Limitations

*   **Extremely Basic:** This example only does simple string matching.  It does *not* handle more complex URL patterns or content analysis.
*   **No Real Security:**  It is trivial to bypass this simple blacklist.
*   **Not Suitable for Real-World Use:** This code is *not* robust or secure enough for actual parental control purposes.
*   **Ethical and Legal Concerns:**  Real-world parental control systems must address ethical and legal considerations related to privacy, transparency, and consent.  This example does *not* address these issues.

## Future Improvements (For Illustrative Purposes Only)

*   Implement more sophisticated URL matching (e.g., using regular expressions).
*   Add content filtering based on keywords or other criteria.
*   Implement time limits or usage schedules.
*   Consider user profiles and different restriction levels.

**Again, I must emphasize that this code is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used in any real-world scenario without significant modifications and addressing the ethical and legal implications.  Please use established parental control software for actual parental control needs.**
